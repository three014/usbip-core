# usbip-core

A userspace library for interacting with the vhci kernel drivers.

---

This is a rust port of two major libraries, [usbip-win2](https://github.com/vadimgrn/usbip-win2) (Windows) and [usbip-utils](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/tools/usb/usbip) (Linux).
Currently only the client-side is being ported, but future work will port the server-side for at least Linux.
